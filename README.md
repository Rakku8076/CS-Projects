# Paperless Judicial System
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION


1.0	INTRODUCTION 

What is a Paperless Court? 
According to recent research, the paperless court theory has been in existence since 1993. The Midtown Community Court in the state of New York transitioned into a paperless court over 21 years ago. As a result, the court opened a new location due to the increased volume of misdemeanor cases. The Midtown Community Court targets quality-of-life offenses, such as prostitution, illegal vending, graffiti, shoplifting, fare beating and vandalism. By providing better information, the court’s award-winning computer application helps the judge craft individualized sanctions for each offender and monitor compliance. The system also provides police officers with regular feedback about the outcome of the arrests they made. As a result, there have been many cities around the world that have opened community courts based on the model of the Midtown Community Court, which have received national award recognition for its endeavors.

Paper has served the judicial system well, in terms of documenting and preserving, pleadings, evidence and orders / judgements. But there are problems with a paper-based system Not eco-friendly. Requires more and more storage space. Paper necessarily involves care and maintenance for its preservation and places a heavy demand on human resources. A lot of time and energy is spent on the management of paper files for filing, retrieval, transportation and preservation. 

1.1 Technology used? 
1.1.1 Mongo DB 
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server-Side Public License (SSPL).
Main-Features
1.	Indexing
2.	Replication
3.	File Storage
4.	Server-Side JavaScript execution

1.1.2	JavaScript

JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
1.1.3	Node JS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
1.1.4	Font Awesome

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing Font Awesome in second place after Google Fonts.
It is a library of icons in which you can find various icons for css based toolkit.

1.2 OBJECTIVE
          
1.2.1   Full case information is available immediately to attorneys, parties, and the general public through the Internet, including the ability to view the full text of all filed documents. 

1.2.2   Parties, the judge, court staff and the public all can        review the case file simultaneously.

1.2.3   Since all the documents would be in digital form, it would solve the problem of shortage of storage space.

1.2.4	  Since it would be a paperless and automated court, it would reduce the burden on human resources.

1.2.5	  Would entail that from presentation of a complaint or petition till its disposal and archival, no paper is used!

1.2.6	  Paperless courts would lead to increased efficiency and would save time.
